Proactive awareness and community intelligence reduce harm

## Problem Statement
Colorado College has a disturbingly disproportionate number of sexual assault cases every year. One glaring issue in fighting against SA within our community is that the number of cases is dwarfed by the unofficial count amongst students, particularly fem identifying and non-white students. The Title IX office does not put out annual statistics reports on its case number, or severity. Many students who may potentially report, or have reported in the past, feel uncomfortable with the Title IX approach to resolution, mediation/discipline and evidence/investigative based thinking. Some students have had their cases swept under the rug outright, with no follow up or solution. Offices like SARC are there to help mitigate these effects, but ultimately, are still there in response rather than as a proactive resistance to this SA culture at Colorado College.

Campus safety also plays a role in the distortion of these already obscured statistics on sexual violence. While there were 51 total reports within the category “sex related crimes” in the last 3 years (which is a gross undercounting), there were 0 “sex related crimes” in the “bias-related crime” chart. There were only three “bias-motivated” crimes in the entire three year span of the report. Those last two figures are egregious to say the least, and amount to a violent act of misinformation towards students of marginalized identity(ies) at the school. The lack of coordination between the Title IX office and campus safety, as well as absence of any transparent record of violence and crime on campus towards students of marginalized identities creates an environment that hides past violence from younger students, and propagates these environments that allow for violence. Students who do not know these issues are more likely to join environments that have the potential to harm themselves or others.
