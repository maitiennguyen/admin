    String whySRASDescription = "Our team created Student Reports and Statistics (SRAS) for college students to anonymously " +
            "report and track data on crime and sexual harassment activity that has occurred on campus. SRAS aims to " +
            "provide transparent information and report tracking for students to ensure that all students have access " +
            "to accurate and relevant information about campus safety.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "We understand that the current data that’s released by Campus Safety is not the most accurate representation " +
            "of the many incidents that have occurred on campus. This mainly has to do with the fact that Campus Safety is " +
            "only allowed to report certain things to the federal government. Our hope is that with this platform, students " +
            "have access to better incident information and report submissions while still maintaining their anonymity. \n" +
            "\n" +
            "That being said, our platform is not replacing any of the resources that already exist on campus. We want " +
            "our users to think of our platform as an additional resource, and it is why we have done our best to include " +
            "other on campus and off campus resources.\n";
    String ourGoalsDescription = "Our primary goal is to improve campus safety by empowering students with the knowledge " +
            "and resources they need to make informed decisions about their activities. We believe we accomplish that by " +
            "providing anonymous reporting, displaying transparent information, and listing other additional resources on " +
            "and off campus.  \n" +
            "\n" +
            "Another one of our goals is to be as user friendly as possible, especially when it comes to filling out a " +
            "report. We know how difficult it can be to describe a personal experience that may have been more negative " +
            "than positive, and that is why we only require three questions to be answered. If at any time the user feels " +
            "that they cannot finish the report or decide that they no longer want to file the report, they can either press " +
            "the back or exit button and rest assured that our program will not save anything they previously filled out. \n";
    String dataUsageDescription = "Our data comes from the database that stores every successfully submitted report. " +
            "We only use certain information for that data. For example, total number of reports, average mental " +
            "health impact, and how many incidents occurred between certain dates. SRAS has no intention of sharing " +
            "all of the content that’s in each report after they’ve been submitted to our database. Users should rest " +
            "assured that their personal text entries will not be displayed on our platform.  We will only use relevant " +
            "data to give a more accurate reflection of crime and sexual harassment activity that’s happened on campus. ";
